# Geo_tagged_tweets_visualization.github.io
For this project, I focused on geo_tagged tweets of two different countries, which is *The United States* and *Canada*. How does the distribution of tweets differ by each countries geographically and is there similarity between these countries. Also what are the common words that have been used in the tweets. 
## Analysis 
From the result of analysis about Geo-tagged tweets, there are the likelihood of where population concentrates have higher cluster of tweets in both countries. However, amount of tweets in Canada was much less than amount of tweets in the Untied States. Therefore, it might be use of Twitter are not the *trends* in Canada anymore. 
Comparing the word art of two countries, the most common words that both countries use are similar. *"CO"* is the most common words in both countries however, I would like to exclude this words. Because I assume CO is like a word that is included to every tweets. Also, when I compare the patterns of those two diagrams, there was not that big different between those two countries. I was assuming that words like **"COVID"** or **"Ukraine"** could be trends or most commonly used words in both countries because of recent situation. However, it does not strongly affect the contents of tweets itself.
